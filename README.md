Full details of the algorithm and its validation are described in [Development and prospective validation of COVID-19 chest X-ray screening model for patients attending emergency departments](www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99986-3)

Chest X-Rays (CXRs) are the first-line investigation in patients presenting to emergency department (ED) with dyspnoea and are a valuable adjunct to clinical management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to facilitate rapid triage of CXRs for further patient testing and/or isolation. In this work we develop an AI algorithm, CovIx, to differentiate Normal, Abnormal, Non-COVID-19 Pneumonia, and COVID-19 CXRs using a multicentre cohort of 293,143 CXRs. The algorithm is prospectively validated in 3,289 CXRs acquired from patients presenting to ED with symptoms of COVID-19 across four sites in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. CovIx achieves Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve for COVID-19 of 0.86, with sensitivity and F1-score up to 0.83 and 0.71 respectively, and performs on-par with four board-certified radiologists. AI-based algorithms can identify CXRs with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID pneumonias in symptomatic patients presenting to ED.
